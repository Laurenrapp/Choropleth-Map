<!-- 150 WORD STORY GOES HERE-->
<div>
<p class="container_2"> Mayor Adam’s kicked off a year full of rat fighting initiative with his appointment of Kathleen Corradi, the city’s first Rat Czar’ in April. Her appointment was made in conjunction with a multimillion-dollar campaign to reduce rats throughout New York City, including a 3.5 million dollar Harlem Rat Mitigation Zone, new trash cans programs, and spraying carbon monoxide into rat burrows. In 2023, there were 6,340 rat sightings reported to New York Cities 311 hotline, a decrease for the 7,059 in 2022. </p>

<div>
<p class="container_2"> Stated in a press release from the city regarding the Rat Czar’s appointment, NYC received a donation of Tomcat rodent control products to help with rat mitigation. Jodi Lee, vice president of controls at Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, which owns Tomcat says, "Rodent control starts with preventive measures, such as removing access to water and food sources, and includes proven rodent control products for challenging settings." Mitigation tactics have helped 311 reports drop 10% in one year. </p>
